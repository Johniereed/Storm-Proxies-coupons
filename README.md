## Cost vs. Performance: Are Residential Proxies Worth It?

You might be wondering if it's worth going for residential proxies like the ones offered by Storm Proxies.

Sure, residential proxies cost a bit more upfront. But in the long run, they can save you a ton of time and headaches.

Plus, with those Storm Proxies coupons, the cost becomes a whole lot more manageable.
